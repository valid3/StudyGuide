## Algorithms:
#### - Misspelling Algorithm!
- This algorithm is simple but can be helpful and ensures you don't get frustrated all the time when you misspell a word and submit it! 

How it works is it switches a letter with the one in front of it and adds it to a list. When a answer is submitted each word is checked and compared to this list.
